Fully-convolutional networks for recognizing slab identification numbers

Tensorflow implementation for recognizing slab identification numbers in actual factory scenes.
The architecture of VGG19 was utilized to construct a fully-convolutional network, and reduced number of 1x1 convolution filters were used
